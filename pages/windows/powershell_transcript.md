### Overview

`PowerShell Transcript` is a mechanism to record a `PowerShell` console
session. The full console input and, depending on the transcript configuration,
`stdout` and `stderr` streams are logged to a text file. This logging
mechanism, disabled by default, is the only Windows built-in feature to gain
extended visibility on `PowerShell` console interactions, and in particular to
the results of `PowerShell` commands entered in a console.

Contrary to `Script Block Logging` however, `PowerShell Transcript` does not
include content of scripts executed and only the commands as they are entered /
typed in the `PowerShell` console (and thus potentially obfuscated).

`PowerShell Transcript` is available from `PowerShell 2.0` and onward, with
a different default file naming convention starting with `PowerShell 5.0`:

  - Before `PowerShell 5.0`: `PowerShell_transcript.YYYYMMDDHHmmss.txt`, with
    the timestamp being in the system local timezone.

  - Starting with `PowerShell 5.0`:
    `PowerShell_transcript.<HOSTNAME>.<8_RANDOM_CHAR>.YYYYMMDDHHmmss.txt`
    (with the timestamp also in the system local timezone).

By default, `PowerShell Transcript` logs will be located directly under
a user's `Documents` folder (`<USERPROFILE>\Documents`), with one file per
"transcripted" console session. An alternative path, on the local filesystem or
on a remote server, can be specified. A number of known paths are referenced in
the [`KAPE` target `PowerShellTranscripts`](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/Windows/PowerShellTranscripts.tkape).

#### Enabling PowerShell Transcript

`PowerShell Transcript` can be enabled in a number of ways. By default, only
the timestamps of the `PowerShell` session start and end are logged and an
additional configuration is required to log the timestamp of each command
execution.

  - For the current `PowerShell` console session, using the `Start-Transcript`
    cmdlet. The `IncludeInvocationHeader` switch toggles the logging of command
    execution timestamps. This cmdlet can be added to a user
    `PowerShell profile` to be automatically executed upon new `PowerShell`
    session. The `PowerShell profile` can however be trivially bypassed by
    launching a session with out loading the profile
    (`powershell.exe â€“NoProfile`).

  - Through `Group Policy`: Computer configuration -> Polices -> Administrative
    Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows PowerShell ->
    "Turn on PowerShell Transcription". As stated in the `GPO` setting, this is
    equivalent of calling the `Start-Transcript` cmdlet for every `PowerShell`
    session. The "Include invocation headers" checkbox determine, similarly to
    the `IncludeInvocationHeader` switch, wether execution timestamps should be
    logged for each command.

  - Directly through the registry, by setting the values,
    under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription`,
    `EnableTranscripting` to `0x1` and `EnableInvocationHeader` to `0x1` (to
    enable commands timestamps). While supporting the `Start-Transcript`
    cmdlet, `PowerShell core` does not however appear to take into account
    these values.

### Information of interest

Each `PowerShell Transcript` is associated with a `PowerShell` session and
include:

  - The user associated with the session.

  - The timestamps of the session start and finish (once the session is
    closed).

  - The `Process ID (PID)` of the `PowerShell` process linked to the session.

  - The `PowerShell` edition (`desktop`, `core`) and version used.

  - Each commands entered / typed in the session, their working directory (as
    the `PowerSehll` prompt is logged as well), and their respective `stdout`
    and `stderr` outputs.

  - [If enabled](#enabling-powershell-transcript), the timestamp of each
    command execution, in `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` format and in the system local
    timezone.

Example of a `PowerShell Transcript` log file (with command execution
timestamps) `PowerShell_transcript.HOSTNAME.AZCz+5lm.20240615001946.txt`:
