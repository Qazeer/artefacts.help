A number of log sources are available in `Azure`, that can be useful for
incident response purposes:

| Source | Description | History | Mechanism used |
|--------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| [`Azure AD sign-ins logs`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins) | Logs Azure AD sign-ins and resources usage. <br><br> Entries are stored in `UTC+0`. | 7 days by default. <br><br> 30 days for Microsoft Entra ID P1P2. | `MS Graph API` |
| [`Azure AD audit logs`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs) | Logs changes applied to the Azure AD tenant, such as users or group management and updates. <br><br> Entries are stored in `UTC+0`. | 7 days by default. <br><br> 30 days for Microsoft Entra ID P1P2. | `MS Graph API` |
| [`Office 365 Unified Audit Logs`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance) | All Office 365 logs (including Azure AD logs with a more limited level of information). <br><br> Entries are stored in `UTC+0`. <br><br> There can be a delay of around 30min for logs to be available in UAL and up to 24 hours for AAD logs (and Power Automate, Power Apps, and Yammer logs). <br><br> As of October 2021, `Audit Logs` are by default turned on for newly created tenants. | 180 days since October 17, 2023, 90 days before (by default). <br><br> 1 year for users assigned a E5 license.	| `Exchange online PowerShell` |
| [`Mailbox Audit Log`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/enable-mailbox-auditing) | Logs certain actions performed on mailboxes by mailbox owners, delegates, and admins. For instance, log entries can be generated upon mail data access, email deletion or sending, etc. <br><br> As of January 2019, `mailbox audit logs` should be turned on by default for newly created tenants. [As stated in the Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-mailboxes?view=o365-worldwide), the `mailbox audit logs` are reliably sent to the `Office 365 Unified Audit Logs` only for users with E5/A5/G5 licenses or mailboxes with `mailbox audit logs` explicitly enabled (even if `mailbox audit logs` is implicitly enabled by default for every mailboxes). Events for users with non E5 licenses or `mailbox audit logs` not explicitly enabled should generally be sent to the `Office 365 Unified Audit Logs` but may not depending on performance reason. <br><br> A predefined set of mailbox actions are audited by default for each logon type (`Admin`, `Delegate`, and `Owner`). The list of actions logged by default can be found in the [official Exchange documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-mailboxes). Note that while mailbox auditing cannot be disabled for a specific mailbox if mailbox auditing is enabled tenant-wide, mailbox audit logging can still be bypassed by defined users. In such circumstances, mailbox `Owner` actions as well as `Delegate` (i.e on other users' mailboxes) and `Admin` actions performed by the bypassed users aren't logged. <br><br> Mailbox logon types: <br> - `Owner`: access by the mailbox owner. <br> - `Delegate`: access by another user being granted `SendAs`, `SendOnBehalf`, or `FullAccess` (access to everything but not the right to send mails) permission to the mailbox. <br> - `Admin`: mailbox is searched with a Microsoft eDiscovery tool or with the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Editor. <br><br> `MailItemsAccessed` mail access events will only be available with a `E5 license`. Unofficially, a single `E5 license` in the tenant is sufficient to generate the events for all users, even retroactively populating events for the retention period. | 90 days | `Exchange Online PowerShell` |
| [Message Trace](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/announcing-public-preview-of-the-new-message-trace-in-exchange-online/4356561) | Logs metadata and some details on messages sent and received across mailboxes. <br><br> Key information includes: `message id`, subject, sent/received timestamp, sender and recipient email addresses, sending and/or receiving IPs, delivery status (delivered, pending, failed, quarantined, etc.), and message size. <br><br> All records are stored in `UTC+0`. | 90 days (as of December 2024) | `Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module` (`Get-MessageTraceV2` cmdlet) |
| [`Azure Activity logs`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) | Logs activity in an Azure subscription, such as resource modification, virtual machine creation and start, etc. | 30 days | `Azure Monitor RESTAPI` |
| [`Azure DevOps Activity logs`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/audit/azure-devops-auditing) | Logs operations in the Azure DevOps organization(s), such as operations on resources, permissions changes, etc. | 90 days | `Azure DevOps services RESTAPI` |
